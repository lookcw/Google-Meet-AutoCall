# Google Meet AutoCall
##### Google made me rename it to the generic "Video Call Calendar Auto Call" Because extensions are not allowed to have google products in the name. Even if the extension is explicitly made to integrate with that product ðŸ¤·

Do you spend 10 minutes before a meeting, making sure that you donâ€™t miss that meeting? Do you struggle to stay in the flow right before those meetings? Well I do. I created this chrome that will call the you when your meeting starts by opening your google meet meetings with a ringtone. Now, you can concentrate on coding, product managing, data sciencing, or whatever you do, up until right before your meeting.

P.S. If a Product Manager from Google wants to make this better, I beg them to. That would brighten this guys day!

1. Install the Extension [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cilpaaigidlcbbecpdbpgmkgcabncblh)

4. Make sure sync is enabled in your browser. Chrome for some reason wonâ€™t give the extension your email address without it :(

It should work from there!
